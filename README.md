# Spam Detection with LSTM
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect spam messages. The model is trained to classify text messages as either spam or not spam.
## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- keras

You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn keras
```
## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the "SMS Spam Collection Dataset" obtained from Kaggle. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).
